### Abstract:
Error handling in Go is designed to be simple, explicit, and flexible. But when applied to a layered architecture, this simplicity can lead to chaos: verbose error messages, lost context, and debugging headaches that leave developers scrambling for solutions. In our journey, we struggled to trace errors through service, repository, and API layers, often ending up with cryptic logs and unclear root causes.

## Go errors are just values

Go has a straightforward way to handle errors: errors are just values. An error is just a value that implements the error interface with a single method Error() string. Instead of throwing an exception and disrupting the current execution flow, Go functions return an error value alongside other results. The caller can then decide how to handle it: check its value to make decision, wrap with new messages and context, or simply return the error, leaving the handling logic for parent callers.


This talk tells the story of how I tackled error propagation and tracing in a layered architecture. From the initial frustration of Go’s “errors as values” philosophy to experimenting with structured solutions, we uncovered patterns and tools that transformed our approach.

# Talk Description

1 - The Situation / Context:

I won’t spend time ranting about what a layered architecture is, why it’s popular, or the advantages it offers other than to highlight that layered Architecture concepts follows a pattern of having basically 3 layers, Presentation layer, Buisness layer and Persistent layer. Instead, this talk will focus on a specific challenge we encountered working with escalating contextual error messages from the bottom up and a framework that I introduced as the tech lead at the time into our team.

We’re all familiar with the well-renowned pattern:

```
if err != nil {}
```  

This is the standard approach for returning errors, right? Maybe you wrap the error with a bit of `fmt.Errorf()` for additional context. At my current company, where I work as a tech lead, we encountered an issue that became the root of this entire CFP: how to propagate error messages upwards through the layers of our architecture in a consistent, meaningful, and reliable way.


The Challenge

Error handling in Go is supposed to be simple—just return an error, wrap it with a message, and move on. But as our codebase grew, simplicity turned to chaos. With more packages, more developers, and more “quick fixes,” our logs were soon filled with vague error messages like “failed to do this” or “unexpected that.” At times, nobody could tell if the problem stemmed from user input, the server, buggy code, or something completely unpredictable.

To make matters worse, errors were created inconsistently. Each package used its own conventions—different styles, constants, or custom error types. Error codes were added arbitrarily, making it difficult to trace the origin or determine which errors might be returned from a given function without diving deep into the implementation.
